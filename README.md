Recommendation Systems Repository 


How to run ? 

1) Ensure the directory contains all the data in this repository. ( Especially .joblib files )
2) requirements.txt file includes necessary libraries to run this api.
3) from the command line :  python RecommenderApi.py

Note : Use POSTMAN  to send items via POST requests. Response will also be available in the POSTMAN.
In the web page, it can't parse the valid JSON data. So you will probably see a BAD REQUEST ERROR in there. ( somehow could not fix it, let's talk about it later on ).

Examples of request and responses included in the "postman" directory of this repository.

Design doc is included as "Design_Doc.txt".

In the notebooks directory, a notebook is included which you can see the general approach to develop this api.
